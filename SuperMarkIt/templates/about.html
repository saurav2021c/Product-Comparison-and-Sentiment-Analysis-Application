      SuperMarkIt is a website that uses webscraping code written in Python
      to compare the prices of grocery products across the UK's leading
      supermarkets.

      To use the webscraper the SuperUser creates the product and gives it a
      Category and Name. In this same section the URL for each supermarket
      is then entered and stored into the database. Once the load-prices.py file
      is ran it will go through each URL in the database and scrape the prices
      from each webpage. Erroneous URLs/prices will be flagged in the terminal
      to the user.

      As of April 2024 this webscraper currently works for Tesco, Sainsburys
      and Morrisons.
